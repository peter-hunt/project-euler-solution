# Python ProjectEuler Solution

This is a set of Python personal implementation of solutions to the challenges at [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net)

This will only include solutions of challenges #1-100, here're quotes from [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net)
> We hope that you enjoyed solving this problem. Please do not deprive others of going through the same process by publishing your solution outside of Project Euler. Members found to be spoiling problems beyond #100 will have their accounts locked (see note).

> Note: The rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first 100 problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for them to be discussed elsewhere.


## Usage
Use the following command to run a solution:
```bash
python3 run <index>
```
